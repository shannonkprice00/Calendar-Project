The calendar contains 1 hour time blocks from 8am to 8pm which dynamically change color based on if the time block is in the past, present hour, or future of the users current time. The user can input text and click on the save button which will display a confirmation of save message at the top of the time blocks. The application saves any text to local storage so when refreshing the page, or reloading the page, the user will still have their events in place.
